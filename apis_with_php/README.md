# iceland_october_2021

I attended the class with Santiago, it was brilliant and I felt I learned a lot about how to connect a database and how to retreive data from postman. 
I am not sure what to hand in, so I am handing in the forked respository from Santiago, I also attended the class and tried to be as interactive as I could. 
I watched the last session over the weekend. 

Things that were covered; 

-Seeing few things from the server site and how a backend programmer sets up dataserver
-Learning the three error codes Santiago uses, 200 400 500 and also 404
-Clearing up what our role is on the frontend and his on the backend (when to ask the backend programmer to fix things on their site) 
-Retrieving data from postman 
-Understand the browser URL and it's role
-Understanding about keygen and security
-A little bit about loops

-A rest Api has Get, Post, Delete, Patch
-A normal Api uses Get Post, the naming for that is more specific. 

-Get is when you are retreiving items and its sends the data
-Post is for form data and hide information
-Delete deletes data and something like PHP uses Post and moves the item
-Put to overright data however you must overrite everything in the dataset and be specific if you forget then other data is deleted in the dataset
-You never want to use put on a sql database.
-Patch only the data you want to change changes with patch.
